# Laravel 5 ChatMessenger Demo (+ Pusher)

![Screenshot](acelords-messenger.jpg?raw=true "Screenshot")

This is a demo application for the [Laravel 5 messenger](https://github.com/lexxyungcarter/laravel-5-messenger) to showcase the capabilities for the package.

It is based on [**Laravel 5.8**](https://laravel.com) which is by far the best PHP framework at the time of commit.

## NB
For Laravel versions not supporting php v7.1.3 and up, please refer to `version 1` [v1 branch]. Basically, this applies to Laravel 5.5 and below.

> To get a clear picture of how it works, open two to four browsers (private/incognito mode is perfect for this case) and login with different accounts.

## What's Next

We are working on a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) example since it is a versatile, powerful, and the most popular front-end JS framework.
